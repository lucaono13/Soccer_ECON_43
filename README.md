# Soccer_ECON_43
_________________
Project for ECON 43, Data Wrangling and Visualization, that took data from soccer results in the past 5 years and saw which teams were the best over that time period in their league,  based on win percentage and titles won as well as which leagues are the strongest based on the top 5 teams win percentage (the higher the average win % the stronger).
